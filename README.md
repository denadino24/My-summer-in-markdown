# My Summer in Markdown
# Introduction
Hello, my name is Dena. I am currently in tenth grade and this file will hopefully show a little about me. Some facts about me are that I enjoy playing tennis, I like swimming/ going to the beach, I love spending time with friends and family,I like cooking, I enjoy shopping, and I am a little bit of a foodie. Tennis helps me stay active (while having fun) as well as spend time with my family and friends. Swimming is something that I mostly just do in the summer but it is still really enjoyable to me and also another way of staying active.

# Summer Activities
During summer, I participated in many fun activities with my family. The first activity that I did was go to the beach with my family. We collected many unique seashells, climbed rocks, went on a walk, and looked at the various animals in the tidepools. Although my family and I struggled to find seashells when we first arrived at the beach, the tidepools went down and searching seashells became alot easier. I plan on maybe making some crafts with some of the shells that I have collected with my family. We also saw crabs, snails, sea slugs, abalones, mussels, and e.t.c. in the tide pools. The beach trip was one event that was super fun to me. Another activity that I did was playing tennis with my friends and family. This activity was a great way to get my exercise in, be a little social, improve my skills, and just have fun.

# Favorite Summer Foods
During the summer, most of the foods that I ate were already likeable to me in other seasons aswell however this summer there were some new foods that I tried that were a little popular. During the summer I love to eat cold fruits since it is super refreshing and delicious. I also just love to eat food in general so most foods that I ate during the summer I have already eaten before like sushi, burgers, tacos, burritos, pasta, hot dogs, and e.t.c. One new food/ reciepe I tried was a knafeh, peanut butter filled dark chocolate bar. I tried to replicate the viral pistachio chooclate bar but I did not have the pistachio paste to fill the chocolate with so I used peanut butter instead. It was delicious and tasty. The image below shows the pistachio chocolate bar I was trying to recreate.

# Favorite Summer Memories with Friends
I did many fun things with my friend, I went to the mall with her, ate food with her, chose beads to make bracelets/crafts, played tennis, made slime at the park, and e.t.c. When I went to the mall, my friend and I ate food, walked around, shopped (also window shopped), and talked. Another time in the summer, we went to a crafts store named Joann and we bought four types of beads to make bracelets since there was a sale going on. It was also my first time visitng Joann's. After that we went to the park to create our bracelets, played in the park, and made slime (she dropped slime on her shoes) . Overall theses experiences were very memorable.

# Learning Experiences
During the summer, I took some summer classes. Both classes were online however were different subjects and were taken through different places. I took both Spanish two and Chicano 007. My Spanish two class was taken through Edgenuity and consisted of self paced spanish lessons which was a bit time consuming but my Spanish comprehension got a little better. The second class, Chicano 007, was taken through Pierce College. This class was not self paced and had a profesor giving out the assignments along with class discussions that we had to reply to. In Chicano 007, I gained a better understanding of cultural backgrounds and the hardships that many people had to face. Overall, I learned a lot through my two online classes!
